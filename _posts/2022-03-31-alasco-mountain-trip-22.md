Team events are an important detail at Alasco, and we go as far as to ensure that they are exciting and enjoyable experiences for everyone. Such team events happen at both team, department and company levels.

The modern process of building software requires close collaboration of many stakeholders â€” and that collaboration benefits from inter-team connections and cross-pollination of ideas. While we follow processes in our day to day, good ideas also arise from unplanned interactions. With team events and activities, we are fostering a dense interaction and trust graph at Alasco.
